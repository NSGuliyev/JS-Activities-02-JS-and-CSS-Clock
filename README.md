# Web Agency Project
Web Agency project is a responsive web agency web site.
This project is interesting for two main reasons.
First there is not being use any kind of CSS framework,
something like bootstrap or any other frameforks
Second is for the lay out it is not used any kind of CSS floats or any kind of CIRCE's hacks. 
The styling done by using CSS grid and CSS flexbox.

## Navbar 

## Banner
Right so we're going to be using a flex box wrap property then we're going to be creating a banner.
So this is going to be our having one and we're going to have two buttons right as we're hovering.

## Skills
Then the next section is going to be our skills section right.And you can see that it's going to look exactly like we will be using bootstrap right.
So again if I'm going to make the screens more now I can see the changes to the two columns that are here.
This is going to change to actually single column right.
And you can see that.
Again this is going to be fun.
This is going to be hitting one.
And this is going to be parallel.
So again I'm going to make the screen bigger and we're going to check out the next section that we're
going to be creating.

## Services
So the next section we're going to be creating is going to be services section right.
And again for the whole way out there is going to be CIRCE's grid in use right.
And are we going to achieve this effect by using CSSA right.
So as you can see as I'm hovering actually text is changing right there's going to be some background
text and the text that it's up front is actually moving up right now.
What we're also going to be doing on here is you can see as I'm changing right it's going to be hard
to see right now but ancho are going to change the order of these let's say boxes right.
So we have four boxes and actually on a bigger screen the actual order is different.

## Projects
Right so we're going to you can look at C Ss and order properly right then we're going to have a project
section right.
Logan and just look at how to actually zoom in right would see this or here you can see that we're going
to have in the background right.
So we're going to have a foot or so here and this is going to be let's say our main section right.
Our title.
And again if I make it bigger there's going to be three of them right.
Three project sections right.
And over here if I'm going to make it to the smaller one again we're going to go to the two columns
and then once we actually hit the small screen right we're going to have only a single column here.
Right.
And then after that we're we're going to be doing all right.

## Filler

We have a or here this little filler section right.
Again we're going to be using a CSSA flex box in order to get this effect right.
So they're side by side.
And again if I make it in the smaller screen actually what's going to happen they are going to wrap
around.
So as you can see one the moment they hit each other actually this will wraps underneath the second
one right.

## Posts
Going to have a recent post section right.
Rhodes is going to be using a very very basic CSSA right.
We're going to have this Fantasma appear out of nowhere.
But this is we're going to be working with the cards right.
So you can see that we're going to using We're going to use the SS actually make this card look like
effect right.
And again this is not bootstrap this is just pure success right.

## Footer
And the last hour here is going to be a first session right.
Rose is going to mess around a little bit with these phantasm Mike on the right.
So enough of me yapping.
Let's go to coding and let's start creating this project.
